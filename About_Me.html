<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div class="section">
	<p>Hello, My name is Rohin Chakravarty. I am currently 17 years old, born on 25th of December, 2006.
	I am the second child among the 2 children of my parents. I live in Ruchira Residency, 369, Purbachal 
	Kalitala Road, Kolkata-700078. </p>
	<p>I am currently a 1st year college student, studying in the University of Engineering and Management, dealing 
	with my likes and dislikes. There have been many minor, as well as major, ups and downs in these 4 months I spent 
	studying here. During weekends, I used to do a whole bunch of swimming in the morning and evening before lockdown, 
	but ever since the lockdown was lifted, I was hospitalized during 11th grade, and got diagnozed with seizure 
	disorder, and to prevent it, I have to take daily medication and to leave swimming. I passed out from The Future 
	Foundation School, and in class 7, I decided to enter a public speaking competition, where I was seen as a 
	surprisingly good speaker, also known as, the underdog. Even though I did not get in the top 3, I did get a lot of
	recognition from other public speakers and their faculty. I didn't have any friends in my early school days, since 
	I was never friend material, and certainly not more than friend material, but I did get some respect from some 
	poeple, who, at the end, became my friends. I scored 89.5% in my ISCE examination in 10th grade, and 83.5% in my
	ISC examinations in 12th grade. </p>
